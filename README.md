### Hi there 👋

My real name is Timothy Harris.

I am a software professional and have been in the industry for over twenty years. I have been focused on DevOps and cloud native for quite some years now.

- 🐇 I’m currently down the rabbit hole on:
  - Service based architectures. How small does something have to be, to be called micro? 🤔
  - Containers & Kubernetes
  - Platforms and developer experience
  - Automated SW delivery processes

- 🥙 Some stuff
  - 🐧 Linux is my preferred OS
  - 🗒️ Languages I can get by in ...
    - C, Java, Groovy, Bash, Perl, Python and Powershell(If I have to ☹️).
  - Interested in politics but **not vitriol**

- 📫 How to reach me
